# Housing Prices Prediction Project

## Objective
The primary goal is to create a reliable model that can accurately predict the price of a house in dollars based on:
- The House Size (in square feet)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Age of the House (in years)
- Distance to City Center (in miles)

## Data Description
The dataset is provided by ChatGPT as a simple example of a linear regression problem. The data has a 1000 samples. We split them into training and testing data.

## Results and Evaluation
We used Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure model performance, aiming for lower values. A scatter plot comparing predicted to actual prices visually assesses accuracy.
