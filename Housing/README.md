# Housing Prices Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices, measured in dollars, leveraging several key factors that influence price valuation. By analyzing data points such as house size, the number of bedrooms, age of the house, and proximity to the city center, we develop a predictive model to estimate the market value of houses.

## Objective
The primary goal is to create a reliable model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on:
- The House Size (in square feet)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Age of the House (in years)
- Distance to City Center (in miles)

Through this model, we seek to provide valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts by understanding the dynamics of housing prices.

## Data Description
(Here, you could provide more details about the dataset used, including sources, number of entries, any preprocessing steps taken, etc.)

## Model Implementation
The project utilizes various machine learning techniques, with a focus on (mention the specific models used, e.g., Linear Regression, if applicable). The section could delve into the rationale behind model selection, any feature engineering strategies, and the training process.

## Results and Evaluation
This section should summarize the model's performance, including metrics used to evaluate its accuracy and any validation results. Insights derived from the model's predictions and their implications could also be discussed here.

## How to Run the Code
Provide instructions on how to set up the environment, install necessary dependencies, and run the scripts to reproduce the findings. This might include commands to execute or specific files to look at.

## Conclusion
A brief summary of the project's findings, potential applications of the predictive model, and any future work that could be undertaken to enhance the model's accuracy or scope.
