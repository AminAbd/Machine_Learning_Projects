#Project: Predict Gender from Facial Features

#Objective
The goal of this project is to predict an individual's gender based on various facial characteristics.

#Dataset
The dataset contains information on facial features such as hair length, forehead width and height, nose width and length, lip thickness, and the distance from the nose to the lip. Each entry also includes the individual's gender. This dataset has been constructed for demonstration purposes and is not available on Kaggle.

I#nputs
The dataset includes the following features to be used for gender prediction:

Long Hair (1 for long hair, 0 for short)
Forehead Width (in cm)
Forehead Height (in cm)
Nose Wide (1 if the nose is wide, 0 if not)
Nose Long (1 if the nose is long, 0 if not)
Lips Thin (1 if the lips are thin, 0 if not)
Distance Nose to Lip Long (1 if the distance is long, 0 if not)
#Models Used
Logistic Regression: This model will be used to classify individuals as male or female based on their facial features. The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics appropriate for classification tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, rather than Mean Squared Error (MSE) which is typically used for regression tasks.
