Project#2:  
## Project: Predict Health Insurance Costs

### Objective
The goal of this project is to predict health insurance costs for individuals based on several input variables.

### Inputs
- Age
- Sex
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of Children
- Smoker or Non-Smoker
- Region of the Participants

### Model Used
For this prediction task, we employ **Linear Regression**. This model helps us understand the relationship between the independent variables (inputs) and the dependent variable (health insurance cost) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

### Implementation Details
(Here you can add additional sections detailing your project's implementation, such as data preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, evaluation metrics used, how to run the code, etc.)

### Results
(Provide a summary of the model performance, insights derived from the analysis, and any conclusions drawn.)
